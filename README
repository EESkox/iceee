What is this?
=============

This software is the continuation of the work of 'Grethnefar', a self-described hobbyist programmer who managed to recreate a server for the defunct MMO, Earth Eternal. The game continued as a private server under the name "Planet Forever", until in Spring 2015, he decided to discontinue his work and release the server data, server source, and all of the tools he had created to what remains of the community.

A small team of players started used this to try to continue Greth's amazing work, attempting to complete unfinished content and add new features and mechanics. This source represents the work so far. 


Compiling .. for the impatient
==============================

Preparation
===========

If you have cloned the repository from Git, run the following to generate the configuration scripts. You can skip this if you are using a stable release of the server as this is already done for you and include as part of the archive.

./autogen.sh

Then the usual chant .. 

./configure
make
make install

See the INSTALL file for more information.

Preparing For Use
=================

1. Assets

Before you can run the server you must obtain the 'assets' folder and place it in the root of this project. 

2. Accounts

You'll need a game account to login with (probably at least one 'admin' account too). See DOCUMENTATION for 
details on what to do.

Running
=======

** NOTE ** This is not a complete server. You will need to obtain the 'assets' directory,

Run from the root of this project, i.e. the same directory where this README is.

$ SOURCE/server/planetforeverd


More Information
================

Most of the server configuration, data files and scripts are documented in the DOCUMENTATION directory. 

*This documentation does not yet cover the additions made since the original source release*
