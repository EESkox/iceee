Command line utilities.
All programs are Windows 32-bit console applications.

----  ArchiveExtract.exe  
Extracts CAR files from EarthEternal.archive
This does not decode the CAR files themselves.
Run with no arguments for a list of command switches and parameters.



----  CARDecode.exe 
Encrypt/decrypt CAR files.
Crude disassembler for Squirrel CNUT files (unfinished project, lousy results but may be helpful for certain things).
Also allows script files to perform those individual actions as well modify EarthEternal.archive.  These modifications can easily damage or corrupt the archive.  Keep a backup of the original archive in case something goes wrong.
Windows allows drag and drop to process files.  Drag CAR files to decrypt, ZIP files to
encrypt, CNUT files to disassemble, and TXT files for script.
See opscript.txt for basic commands and usage help.



----  EEUtilAbilityTable.exe
Converts AbilityTable.txt (server file) to a Squirrel NUT source file.
AbilityTable.txt must be present in the working directory.
The resulting NUT file can then be compiled and packaged into the client (Catalogs.car) to update the client's ability table.
Be sure to calculate the MD5 of the new Catalogs.car file and update the server's
HTTPChecksum.txt entry accordingly.



----  MD5.exe
Outputs an MD5 hash of a file.
Run with no arguments to display help.
Alternatively you may use other MD5 hash utilities, easily found on the internet.



----  sq.exe
Squirrel script compiler.  This utility was compiled and included here for convenience.
Squirrel is open source.  You may download and compile your own from:
http://www.squirrel-lang.org/

EE uses the older 2.x stable release.  You may try the recent 3.x version, but you'll need to test for yourself whether the compiled files work with EE.

Basic usage syntax:
sq -o OutputFile.cnut -c SourceFile.nut
