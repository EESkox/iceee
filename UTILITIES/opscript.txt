//  For CARDecode.exe
//
//  -- Drag and drop --
//  Drag and drop files onto the CARDecode executable.  Only works with these file types:
//    CAR files: will be decrypted into a ZIP file
//    ZIP files: will be encrypted into a CAR file
//    CNUT files: will be disassembled into a TXT file
//    TXT files: will be processed as a script.  See commands below.
//
//  If the resulting output file exists, it will be replaced.

//
//  -- Script Actions --
//
// ARCHIVE=path          Drive, path, and folder of the archive file to open
// DIR=path              Change the working directory for other file operations
// RUNFILE=file1,file2   Run encryption on file1, creating decrypted file2
//                       This is reversible, decrypted files will become encrypted.
// REPLACE=file1,file2   Search for file1 in the archive, and replace with data
//                       from file2.
//                       File1 requires at least a partial match, but should be
//                       unique enough to specify the target file rather than
//                       multiples.
//                       File2 must be a valid encrypted CAR file.
// EXPORT=file           Dumps archive file table data to a text file.
// OPEN                  Opens the archive file for operations that require it.
// CLOSE                 Closes the archive file.
// APPEND=file           Append a file to the end of the archive file.
// END                   Stop script immediately.
// LINKFILE=file1,file2  Append file2 to the archive, updating the archive entry data
//                       for file1.  WARNING! In some cases this may corrupt the archive.
// RESETMD5              Recalculates and rewrites the MD5 hash of the file table.
//                       Needs to be used before the archive is closed whenever LINKFILE is
//                       processed, otherwise the archive will be considered corrupt by the game.
//RUNCNUT=file1,file2    Dissassemble a CNUT file (file1) and optionally save the output to file2.
//CLEAN=file1            Creates a new archive file (file1) and copies all file entry data from the
//                       open archive into the new archive, effectively creating a new archive
//                       clean of junk file data.




//  Here is an example to load an existing archive, convert a ZIP back into a CAR,
//  then patch the updated CAR into the archive (just uncomment the lines).

// ARCHIVE=C:\Games\EEProject86\cache\EarthEternal.archive
// OPEN
// RUNFILE=EarthEternal.zip,EarthEternal.car
// LINKFILE=EarthEternal.car,EarthEternal.car
// RESETMD5
// CLOSE
// END
