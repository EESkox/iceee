Title=Speak with the Captain
BodyText=Hmm... Yes, I see... Old Ironbirch was wise to have this taken out of the hands of those Khazechek fools in the Deadwood. Had their plans to 'summon' up the object of their worship succeeded, I fear the Deadwood would be facing a far more formidable foe than merely the reborn Khazekeela or indeed the Pact of Decay itself. You see, this is, as you were told, indeed not the hand of that witch; but is in fact, the hand of a powerful Lich that once roamed the countrysides of Grunes Tal. We Redeemers managed to destroy this Lich years ago and it was thought no further harm would come from him. This hand's existance proves that is sadly not the case. How the Khazechek found this thing is not important. What IS important is that you have procured it from them before something terrible happened.

For years my family have been experts on the handling of the Undead and we have learned various ways of purifying and disposing of various objects related to them. As such, I shall take the Lich's hand and see what can be done to destroy it. Though, there is the chance darker forces are involved. If this is the case, merely destroying this thing would be just the beginning.

In the meantime, friend, as you have probably noticed we at Redeemer's Hall are at constant odds with the Undead threat here in Grunes Tal. If you would like to join in our fight to halt the advance of the Legions of Sheol, please talk to Captain Zaris, he is the officer in charge here at the Hall. Any assistance in the fight against Abidan's forces is always welcome.

Title=Death's Hollow
BodyText=Hello friend and welcome to Redeemer's Hall. While our main duties are to stem the tide of the Vampire Palatine Drakul's forces, which have already reached deep into Swineland to the northeast, those of us stationed here have a secondary duty to beastkind. Here, deep in the heart of Grunes Tal, we have long held back the advancing forces of Abidan which have spilled out of the underrealm and laid waste to this entire region.

Grunes Tal was once a thriving mining region that prospered through the ores excavated from the mountains here. Chief among the towns that grew wealthy from the ore was Alpenhold. The iron mines of Alpenhold were said to be among the largest in the region and the city became a famous centre of trade.

Unfortunately, this attracted our old foes the Outcasts which set off a series of conflicts today known simply as 'The Outcast Wars'. For years, the beasts of Grunes Tal staved off the Outcasts to protect their mines and wealth; however, little did they know, a much greater threat would soon cast its shadow upon the land.

It happened in one of the mines in the Iron Hills to the east near Alpenhold itself. As the miners delved ever deeper into the earth seeking that which made their people rich, they eventually broke through into a previously unknown cavern deep underground. Curiosity overcoming caution, the miners began to explore this newly discovered cavern. Finding nothing save that it stretched on and on, they returned to the surface to report what they had discovered.

Unbeknownst to those unfortunate miners, the cavern they had dug into led into the Underrealm itself. Before long, the agents of Abidan began to pour forth out of the mine, quickly surrounding Alpenhold. All efforts to hold them back failed and, soon, the great city of Alpenhold fell to the onslaught of the Legions of Sheol.

The survivors who fled the Undead assault, retreated west to the fertile lands of the Greenfeld, occupied by both Beast and Outcast alike.  A few notable families, unfortunately, were stubborn in their ways and refused to give up on Alpenhold. Among those families was the now-infamous House of Folkirk. The Folkirks, a wealthy noble family, refused to relocate far from Alpenhold and instead headed north, settling on a hill just south of the Junderlund where they built their new home, Folkirk Manor.

For a number of years, the beasts of the Greenfeld struggled between fighting the Undead threat that continued to spread throughout Grunes Tal and the Outcasts who still remained in the region. Unfortunately, it was only a matter of time before the Undead gained enough strength to overcome even the strongest defenses. Around two hundred years past, the Legions of Sheol finally overwhelmed the people living in the Greenfeld and neither Beast nor Outcast got far before falling before the Undead might. Folkirk Manor had been one of the early losses and before long, those that did not flee to the neighboring lands were killed.

In these final days of prosperity, Redeemer's Hall was built by some of our members who had been sent West to aid the people of Grunes Tal and it soon became the final bastion of beast life within Grunes Tal. Even today, we, the Redeemers, have done our utmost to make certain the Legions of Sheol have been unable to fully invade other Beast lands still largely untouched by Abidan's forces. As for the Greenfeld, it has become darkened and is now known as Death's Hollow  -- named so in testament to the many losses incurred there.

Northwest of here lies what was once Greenfeld City. Now called Shadowfield City, it is inhabited by the unliving remains of those who were there when it fell. South of the city there is a series of farms whose undead residents still roam the land. Your task is to open the road by eliminating Taskmaster Glutt. As his name suggests, he is leader of the Farmhands that still tend the farms. Recent intel suggests he has been recently organizing them for a much more sinister purpose and so we want him taken out. Once he is out of the way, the disorganized Farmhands should prove to be easy targets. Return to me with the Taskmaster's Rake as proof of his demise and I will see to it that you are rewarded for your efforts.
CompleteText=Excellent work! Without Glutt to lead them, those undead farmhands should be more disorganized and easy to pick off. As promised, here is your reward with my thanks.

Title=General Bodiccea
BodyText=Now that Glutt is out of the way, we can move on Shadowfield itself. Be warned though, that the city will not be taken so easily. Stationed within the city is a warrior with a tragic story.

General Bodiccea was once a warrior of great reknown and a highly respected beast. Legend has it Bodiccea and her troops were able to hold back the Undead for several years before this region fell to their onslaught. Her last stand was in Greenfeld City, now called Shadowfield, where she and her forces fought to the last beast while the citizens were evacuated. The story goes that after several days of battle, the Undead finally infiltrated the city and slaughtered all who remained, including Bodiccea and her troops. Even in death, Bodiccea was not to be deterred and she continues to guard the Shadowfield to this very day.

While her cause in life was selfless and noble, Bodiccea and her troops now fight mindlessly, forever trapped in bodies long since robbed of life. Your task is to enter Shadowfield City and put to rest Bodiccea and her followers once and for all. Return to me once you have freed the General and her troops from their pain and restored those tragic heroes to Gaia's embrace.
CompleteText=You have again returned safely! With Shadowfield City removed as a threat, we can now move supplies to and from our allies in Swineland much easier. I truly hope Bodiccea is now at peace, along with those who died with her while defending beastkind in their darkest hour here in Grunes Tal. Thank you for finally putting them to rest at last.

Title=Caretakers of the Lanterns
BodyText=Friend! Yes, you there! If you are headed out to the farms around Shadowfield would you be willing to perform a task for us as well? You see, we are... how to say... the 'lanternkeepers' of Grunes Tal. It is a largely thankless job and a dangerous one as well! Simply put, we are in charge of maintaining the lanterns that can be found all along the roads of Grunes Tal and here at the Hall and making certain they are kept lit. While this doesn't exactly drive off the hordes of Undead, it DOES serve to keep our paths visible; especially when travelling during the night.

As for your task? Yes, well, you see... over the long years, it was discovered that the glowing iridescence within the eyes of the local Spiteful Lanterneyes lit up the night rather well. Further research discovered that this iridescence was to be found within the fluid in the eyes. Over time, some of us Redeemers found a way to preserve this fluid so that it could be used as a source of natural light. Every few months to a year or so, we go out and hunt the Lanterneyes for their eye fluid until we have a good size supply to last us for a good while. Once again, our stores of Lanterneye Eye Fluid has begun to run low and unfortunately, due to the recent activity in the area, we have been unable to go out and collect the fluid ourselves.

This is where you come in! All we ask is that you gather a good... let's say...thirty...yes, thirty vials of fluid sounds good enough... of the eye fluid from the Spiteful Lanterneyes. Once you have them, return to me and I shall pay you a fair sum for the lot.
CompleteText=You have the vials of Eye Fluid! Friend, if only you knew how much time you have spared us in our already thankless task here in these dark lands. As promised, here is your reward and our thanks for your help.
