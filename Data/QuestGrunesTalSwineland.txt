Title=The Trailblazers
BodyText=Beast friend of the Treekin, you have already done much in our fight against the Pact of Decay and their ilk against our forest; however, there is another matter I would like for you to deal with.

To the south of the Dire Murk at the very edge of the Great Forest you will find a portion of the forest that has been cut down. Roaming in that vicinity you will find a foolhardy group of enterprising members of your own kind who call themselves the Trailblazers. Some time ago, they came to the Treekin offering to help in our fight with the Pact of Decay. We were a bit wary of their methods, though, as they suggested we divide the forest between the healthy trees and the ones infected with decay. At length, we discussed the proposal and decided such measures were not in our interests as our goal is not only to stop the spread of the decay but to force its retreat.

The Trailblazers did not seem too pleased with our decision and eventually departed the Heartwood, their seeming venture rejected. Recently, we have received reports they have returned to our forest uninvited and have been indiscriminately cutting down everything in sight. We, the Treekin, cannot allow this to stand, yet with nearly all of our resources focused on dealing with the Pact of Decay, we have been unable to get them to stop their operation.

As much as I do not wish to make such a request, I ask that you go to the Trailblazers' encampment and thin their numbers. With fewer workers chopping down our trees, the damage done can be minimized. However, to truly get the Trailblazers to cease their activities, you must defeat those in charge as well. 

Without their superiors, the remaining Trailblazers should abandon their little venture and return from wherever it is they came. Intel says their supervisor is called simply "Babe the Blue" or some such nonsense. Then there is the Trailblazers' Foreman, Pawl. Pawl will not show himself unless their operations are disrupted and Babe the Blue will likely not make an appearance unless Pawl is eliminated.

Go now and drive these uninvited pests from the forest!
CompleteText=So, those foolhardy pests have finally been dealt with? Excellent. I greatly appreciate your handling of this matter. With the Trailblazers eliminated, the areas they affected with their incessant logging efforts can begin the slow process of recovery. In the meantime, we the Treekin will continue our efforts at holding back the Pact of Decay. For your efforts, please accept one of these with my thanks and the thanks of all in the Great Forest.

Title=Lords of the Rot
BodyText=So, you would like to help us in our fight here at the front lines do you? Well, perhaps you can begin by heading deep into the Deadwood and locating the three Rotted Groves within the Box Blight. These groves are tainted with the rot and serve to aid in the propagation of the black shroomie spores throughout Box Blight.

Lording over these groves are three minions of the Pact of Decay. Both Buxusbane and Volutella are often seen within the western and northeastern groves, while the third, Blighton Deadroot, is reported to make his rounds between the two eastern groves near the lake.

Head to the Rotted Groves of the Box Blight and destroy these lords of the rot and poison that is the Pact of Decay!
CompleteText=You made short work of them. Most excellent. The next task I have for you, though, will not be as easy.

Title=Wither-Root
BodyText=Now that the Rotted Groves are no longer a threat it is time to press the issue by crippling the Pact of Decay where they start.

To the south of Green Line Thicket you will find a most vile grove which we have learned is the 'breeding grounds', as it were, of the Rotted. The 'Rotted Nursery' they call it. Now, they don't multiply as Mother Gaia intended, no. The Pact of Decay's method of increasing their numbers is much more vile. I won't go into the details of what horrors are wrought within that place; however, I will tell you of a specific Rotted known as Wither-Root. This particular Rotted is a nasty fellow and many young seedlings fall prey to his machinations within that corrupted grove.

With him are two 'assistants', if you could call them that. One is a corrupted dryad named Branchesca. Reports claim she is the one who assists in the corruption process of the Treekin saplings and nurses the newly turned Rotted into powerful members of the Pact of Decay. The other is a Black Shroomie called Sparren Rotgut. This fellow lords over the others of his kind within the Nursery and directly aids in the spreading of the deadly spores which infects the saplings.

Head to the Rotted Nursery and eliminate both Branchesca and Sparren Rotgut. Once these two vile beings have been dealt with, you must find and defeat Wither-Root himself. Reports claim he will not show himself that easily; however, you might get him to come out of hiding by destroying his minions.

Return here once they have felt the true sting of death!
CompleteText=So, Wither-Root and his followers are finally destroyed? That is great news indeed. This will put a nice dent in the goals of the Pact of Decay for sure! Thank you for all your help in driving back our enemies!

Once again, your skills are needed for another task in our fair land. We here in Castle Camelot recently received word from Ironstone Watch, located to the southwest of Stonehenge, that all is not well over there. I would ask you to travel to Ironstone Watch and speak with the current watchkeeper Shelby Marsh. She will surely update you on the situation. The King would send reinforcements there himself, but, with the stirrings of Avalon in recent times, we dare not spread ourselves thin.

Please, on behalf of the people of Anglorum I ask you to take this task.

Title=The Ironstone Quarry
BodyText=In your travels down to this part of Anglorum, you might have noticed the ground, along with the temperature, in this area begin to abruptly change. Where the rest of Anglorum enjoys the changing of the seasons that bring with them heat, rain, and snow, the region of southwestern Anglorum known as Ironstone, named so because of the durable stone that was once quarried there, is covered in ice and snow all year round. I can assure you this is by no means a natural phenomenon.

Long ago when the quarries were still active, the climate of Ironstone was much different than it is now and was pretty much the same as the rest of Anglorum. Following a catastrophe, however, the temperature began to rapidly cool and everything began to freeze. The beasts of Anglorum abandoned Ironstone and fled for their lives northward...though not simply because of the climate change.

Deep in a cave in the far southwesternmost peninsula of Ironstone, quarriers uncovered a slumbering beast, a dragon if you can believe it - that apparently had been buried for an untold amount of years. Disturbed by those excavating the stone, the beast awakened one day and completely laid waste to the entre area. It was this dragon, who has been given the moniker Grimfrost, that forced the beasts to abandon Ironstone.

This outpost, dubbed the Ironstone Watch, was constructed soon after Grimfrost returned to her slumber as a means of monitoring the area for any sign she might become active again.

In the meantime, the old quarries, now long ago abandoned, have become infested with monsters. If that wasn't enough, a strange group of Yeti have settled in the now frozen landscape. Calling themselves 'The Brood of Grimfrost', these 'Beasts', if you could call them such, seem to worship the dragon. There are even reports that claim they believe themselves to be the very offspring of that horrid beast! What utter nonsense! Worse, though, it seems these 'Brood of Grimfrost' yeti have become active. They have been organizing of late and moving north, even to the very edge of the snow cover, where, even here in the Watch, we can see them from a distance. That can mean only one thing - the dragon, itself, may very well be awake again.

If you indeed wish to assist us in our work here, then here is your first task. Eliminate as many of those accursed 'Brood' yeti off of Gaia's earth as you can. By thinning their numbers, perhaps their threat can be greatly reduced.
CompleteText=Excellent work, but, I assure you there is more to be done here.

Title=The Frostbound Djinn
BodyText=While the Grimfrost Brood yeti are indeed strong, there is a much worse foe that has also settled in the shadow of Grimfrost's mountain cave. Where they came from is not known; however, what is known, is that soon after Ironstone was turned to frost and ice, a group of djinn soon migrated in. Lead by a powerful djinn named Al'zahrazzi, these Frostbound Marid djinn proved to be quite fearsome. Unafraid of the sleeping dragon, the Frostbound Marids have not only laid claim to the long abandoned quarries closest to Grimfrost's cave, but, they have also taken to living within the lair itself! While we cannot confirm an alliance with the Grimfrost Brood yeti, we also cannot allow these djinn to infest Anglorum.

Thus, your next task is to eliminate as many of the Frostbound Marid djinn infesting the quarries as possible. With their numbers diminished, they would hopefully choose not to press the issue further.
CompleteText=You were successful? You are indeed strong, yet the most difficult task remains.

To truly bring an end to these threats, I ask of you to enter Grimfrost's Lair in the mountains on the southwestern peninsula and defeat the leader of the djinn Al'zahrazzi. With him eliminated, the remaining Frostbound djinn should become more disorganized and easier to take care of.

Once you have removed Al'zahrazzi as a threat, head deeper into the heart of the cave and find the resting place of Grimfrost herself. So long as that ancient dragon remains living, all of Anglorum is in peril. You must find her resting place and make certain she never again walks Gaia's earth! For this most harrowing of tasks, I would suggest taking friends with you. May your blade strike true!
CompleteText=Hero, you have returned safely! Gaia be praised! Words cannot express the gratitude of the people of Anglorum this day! Not only have you averted a possible disaster, but, you have made the entire region safer as well. Please, accept one of these gifts as well as my eternal thanks. Farewell!

Title=Speak with the Captain
BodyText=Hmm... Yes, I see... Old Ironbirch was wise to have this taken out of the hands of those Khazechek fools in the Deadwood. Had their plans to 'summon' up the object of their worship succeeded, I fear the Deadwood would be facing a far more formidable foe than merely the reborn Khazekeela or indeed the Pact of Decay itself. You see, this is, as you were told, indeed not the hand of that witch; but is in fact, the hand of a powerful Lich that once roamed the countrysides of Grunes Tal. We Redeemers managed to destroy this Lich years ago and it was thought no further harm would come from him. This hand's existance proves that is sadly not the case. How the Khazechek found this thing is not important. What IS important is that you have procured it from them before something terrible happened.

For years my family have been experts on the handling of the Undead and we have learned various ways of purifying and disposing of various objects related to them. As such, I shall take the Lich's hand and see what can be done to destroy it. Though, there is the chance darker forces are involved. If this is the case, merely destroying this thing would be just the beginning.

In the meantime, friend, as you have probably noticed we at Redeemer's Hall are at constant odds with the Undead threat here in Grunes Tal. If you would like to join in our fight to halt the advance of the Legions of Sheol, please talk to Captain Zaris, he is the officer in charge here at the Hall. Any assistance in the fight against Abidan's forces is always welcome.

Title=Caretakers of the Lanterns
BodyText=Friend! Yes, you there! If you are headed out to the farms around Shadowfield would you be willing to perform a task for us as well? You see, we are... how to say... the 'lanternkeepers' of Grunes Tal. It is a largely thankless job and a dangerous one as well! Simply put, we are in charge of maintaining the lanterns that can be found all along the roads of Grunes Tal and here at the Hall and making certain they are kept lit. While this doesn't exactly drive off the hordes of Undead, it DOES serve to keep our paths visible; especially when travelling during the night.

As for your task? Yes, well, you see... over the long years, it was discovered that the glowing iridescence within the eyes of the local Spiteful Lanterneyes lit up the night rather well. Further research discovered that this iridescence was to be found within the fluid in the eyes. Over time, some of us Redeemers found a way to preserve this fluid so that it could be used as a source of natural light. Every few months to a year or so, we go out and hunt the Lanterneyes for their eye fluid until we have a good size supply to last us for a good while. Once again, our stores of Lanterneye Eye Fluid has begun to run low and unfortunately, due to the recent activity in the area, we have been unable to go out and collect the fluid ourselves.

This is where you come in! All we ask is that you gather a good... let's say...thirty...yes, fifteen vials of fluid sounds good enough... of the eye fluid from the Spiteful Lanterneyes. Once you have them, return to me and I shall pay you a fair sum for the lot.
CompleteText=You have the vials of Eye Fluid! Friend, if only you knew how much time you have spared us in our already thankless task here in these dark lands. As promised, here is your reward and our thanks for your help.

He will know how best to proceed in these matters.

What's this? A message from South Shield? ... ... This is indeed terrible news.

If our problems with Avalon and the Shadow Legion on our doorsteps was not grim enough, now we must deal with this new Faerie threat as well.

*sigh*

Again I must thank you for bringing this to my attention, Hero. Rest assured, I will send what aid I can muster to South Shield to assist in the defenses of Hadrian's Wall. The Faerie must not be allowed to enter our fair land once more!

In the meantime, I believe my Queen has an offer for you as well.

May Gaia be with you, Hero.

Title=The King's Tunnel
BodyText=Greetings from Camelot, Hero of Anglorum! Like my husband, I have heard the tales of your deeds here and abroad and it is an honor to finally have the chance to speak with you.

In fact, I now carry information that may be of interest to you.

We in Anglorum value our allies over on the main continent and do what we can to tighten relations between us whenever possible. It was for this reason I thought of you when a friend of mine who hails from Baffle Gate in the Midlands, sent me word that they are looking for anyone with a taste for adventure. Knowing Reni, though, he would not have bothered me with this sort of information unless there was particular need for such individuals in his homeland.

I have already discussed his request at length with Arthur and he has agreed that just as you have done much for us here in Anglorum, perhaps you can do much for those on the main continent as well. We have already sent word ahead to our guards who defend the Chunnel to the southeast of Camelot to grant the Hero of Anglorum passage to mainland Europe.

What is the Chunnel? The Chunnel is a large tunnel that connects Anglorum to the main continent. Legend claims the ancient passage was constructed during the Age of Man and that it was destroyed during Man's fall. The tunnel was considered lost until enterprising Beasts from Anglorum found and excavated it long ago. It has since been in the care of Anglorum royalty and we consider the Chunnel a valuable asset when sending emissaries to our allies on the mainland and receiving theirs in turn. Because the kings of Anglorum have laid claim to the Chunnel, it is often given the moniker, 'The King's Tunnel' by travelers from abroad.

When you reach Baffle Gate, find my friend Reni Sparda and tell him I have sent you to the Midlands in reply to his petition.

Go now to the Midlands, Hero and Gaia be with you in your travels.
CompleteText=Hello there and welcome to Baffle Gate!

Yes, I am Reni Sparda.

...a message from the Queen?

...so the Lady Guinevere sent you personally?

You must be a great adventurer to have caught the attentions of Camelot, friend! As a matter of fact, your timing could not be more perfect! Hurry over to Mayor Hoffbeast up on the hill over there. He will fill you in if you truly seek adventure here in the Midlands as well.

You see, my supply of needles has run dry and I have been unable to procure more thanks to the recent problems in the Merchants' Guild.

I would be killed before I could get even one needle decent enough for my use. You seem able-bodied enough though. Do me this favor and get me a dozen of those cactus needles for me. Good ones, not mediocre ones! I want them to last! I shall pay you for the trouble.

Forget your notions of shuffling zombies, and remember that these are conniving predators. It will help keep you alive!

We have questioned a few unlucky enough to have been captured, and discovered that they are now laboring under Abidan to construct a Behemoth - a massive zombie constructed of spare parts.

We have nothing to defend against this - unless we construct a behemoth of our own!

There are three camps west of here, inhabited by several types of zombies: Limb-Cullers, Organ-Cullers, and Bone-Cullers. We know that Abidan is grooming these particular undead for their "good parts" to construct a Behemoth.

Travel to these undead camps, and harvest ten each of used limbs, organs and bones from the Organ-Cullers, Bone-Cullers and Limb-Cullers.

We will not only hinder Abidan's efforts, but may create a powerful ally in the process!

Title=The Shadowfield
BodyText=While our main duties are to stem the tide of the Vampire Palatine Drakul's forces which have already reached deep into Swineland to the northeast, those of us stationed here have a secondary duty to beastkind. Here, deep in the heart of Grunes Tal, we have long held back the advancing forces of Abidan which have spilled out of the underrealm and laid waste to this entire region.

Grunes Tal was once a thriving mining region that prospered through the ores excavated from the mountains here. Chief among the towns that grew wealthy from the ore was Alpenhold. The iron mines of Alpenhold were said to be among the largest in the region and the city became a famous centre of trade.

Unfortunately, this attracted our old foes the Outcasts which set off a series of conflicts today known simply as 'The Outcast Wars'. For years, the beasts of Grunes Tal staved off the Outcasts to protect their mines and wealth; however, little did they know, a much greater threat would soon cast its shadow upon the land.



It happened in the largest of the mines in the Iron Hills situated to the east near Alpenhold itself. As the miners delved ever deeper into the earth seeking that which made their people rich, they eventually broke through into a previously unknown cavern deep underground. 

Curiosity overcoming caution, the miners began to explore this newly discovered cavern. Finding nothing save that it stretched on and on, they returned to the surface to report what they had discovered.



Unbeknownst to those unfortunate miners, the cavern they had dug into led into the Underrealm itself. Before long, the agents of Abidan began to pour forth out of the mine, quickly surrounding Alpenhold. All efforts to hold them back failed and, eventually, the great city of Alpenhold fell to the onslaught of the Legions of Sheol.

The survivors who fled the Undead assault retreated west to the fertile lands of the Greenfeld, occupied by both Beast and Outcast alike.  A few notable families, unfortunately, were stubborn in their ways and refused to give up on Alpenhold. Among those families was the now-infamous House of Folkirk. The Folkirks, a wealthy noble family, refused to relocate far from Alpenhold and instead headed north, settling on a hill just south of the Junderlund where they built their new home, Folkirk Manor.

For a number of years, the beasts of the Greenfeld struggled between fighting the Undead threat that continued to spread throughout Grunes Tal and the Outcasts who still remained in the region. 

Unfortunately, it was only a matter of time before the Undead gained enough strength to overcome even the strongest defenses. Around two hundred years past, the Legions of Sheol finally overwhelmed the people living in the Greenfeld and neither Beast nor Outcast got far before falling before the Undead might. Before long, those that did not flee to the neighboring lands were killed.

In these final days of prosperity, Redeemer's Hall was built by some of our members who had been sent West to aid the people of Grunes Tal and it soon became the final bastion of beast life within Grunes Tal. Even today, we, the Redeemers, have done our utmost to make certain the Legions of Sheol have been unable to fully invade other Beast lands still largely untouched by Abidan's forces. As for the Greenfeld, it has become darkened and is now known as the Shadowfield named so in testament to the many losses incurred there.

Now friend, if you truly wish to aid our forces, then here your first task.

Northwest of here lies what was once Greenfeld City. Now called Shadowfield City, it is inhabited by the unliving remains of those who were there when it fell. South of the city there is a series of farms whose undead residents still roam the land. Your task is to open the road by eliminating Taskmaster Glutt. As his name suggests, he is leader of the Farmhands that still tend the farms. Recent intel suggests he has been recently organizing them for a much more sinister purpose and so we want him taken out. While you are there, eliminate a dozen of those Farmhands as well. Without Glutt to lead them, the Farmhands should prove to be easy targets. Return to me with the Taskmaster's Spade as proof that these deeds have been carried out and I will see to it that you are rewarded for your efforts.
CompleteText=Excellent work! Without Glutt to lead them and their numbers thinned a bit, the remaining Farmhands should be more disorganized and easy to pick off. As promised, here is your reward.

BodyText=Now that Glutt is out of the way, we can move on Shadowfield itself. Be warned though, that the city will not be taken so easily. Stationed within the city is a warrior with a tragic story.

General Bodiccea was once a warrior of great reknown and a highly respected beast. 

Legend has it Bodiccea and her troops were able to hold back the Undead for several years before this region fell to their onslaught. Her last stand was in Greenfeld City, now called Shadowfield, where she and her forces fought to the last beast while the citizens were evacuated. The story goes that after several days of battle, the Undead finally infiltrated the city and slaughtered all who remained, including Bodiccea and her troops. Even in death, Bodiccea was not to be deterred and she continues to guard the Shadowfield to this very day.

While her cause in life was selfless and noble, Bodiccea and her troops now fight mindlessly, forever trapped in bodies long since robbed of life. 

Your task is to enter Shadowfield City and put to rest Bodiccea and her followers once and for all. Return to me once you have freed the General and her troops from their pain and restored those tragic heroes to Gaia's embrace.
CompleteText=You have again returned safely! With Shadowfield City removed as a threat, we can now move supplies to and from our allies in Swineland much easier. I truly hope Bodiccea is now at peace, along with those who died with her while defending beastkind in their darkest hour here in Grunes Tal. Thank you for finally putting them to rest at last.

BodyText=Listen not to the others here who scorn me, and label me vain - I am here for profit, and nothing is more profitable than taking advantage of other beasts' vanity!

Note the undead you will encounter in this area. Yes, they are a constant menace, but they carry on quite well and keep their facilities about them rather nicely. Of utmost importance to me however, is the distilling of whatever essence they hold which keeps that wee spark of life within them. If I could harness that without all the unsightly side effects of undead life, I could make a mint!

Travel south of Redeemer's Hall, and you will find a small encampment of undead which serves as the "clinic" for any zombies needing repair. The Undead Chirurgeons within that medical camp carry upon them Scrolls of Everlasting Regeneration. I have seen those scrolls repair years of damage, and even attach severed limbs! Can you imagine what that would do for a few wrinkles?

Gather fifteen Everlasting Regeneration Scrolls from Undead Chirurgeons, and soon I will be able to begin my life of luxury!
CompleteText=You have them? Excellent! Give them to me! Yes, yes! Now I can finally enjoy a long and luxurious life without worry of the effects of aging or any malady out there! What? No, you cannot have them for yourself! Take this bit of coin and be off with you!

But - I prattle on, and here I have a potential ally and fellow  "foody" who might be able to assist me?

The folk embedded in Redeemer's Hall seem to have a "kill on sight" policy with those of us living the rotted half of un-life;  and this quite puts a damper on my ability to procure my favored snack. Will you collect these tasty treasures for me? Gloom-Spites flock amidst the Spiteful Lanterneyes in the blighted fields of Shadowfield.

Title=Misguided Intentions
BodyText=Geoffry Thistlefur was always one of those "quiet" beasts, one who kept out of everybody else's  business well enough, never caused trouble and whatnot. But now - I think to myself - it really IS always the "quiet ones" you need to watch out for now, is it not?

I followed Geoffry on one of his far-ranging "walks" one eve, and stumbled upon his dirty little secret: He has been collecting undead and trying to re-train them as servants to beast-kind!

This will not end well if we let it continue, as the undead are conniving and bear an eternal ember of hatred for beast-kind.

Look within Shadowfield for where Geoffry has hidden these Enslaved Zombies, by travelling from the blighted town of Shadowfield and heading east toward Haunted Hill.

Exterminate the Enslaved Zombies, about six of them I believe, as well as Geoffry Thistlefur. 
CompleteText=Poor Geoffry. He might have meant well, but, sometimes one must stop and consider the consequences before attempting such a foolish task as what he was trying to accomplish. I am sorry you had to kill him, though it was unavoidable as I knew he would try to protect his 'investment' as it were. Perhaps other beasts will learn from Geoffry's mistake and not attempt such a thing in the future.

Listen here, I'm gonna tell you what you're gonna do, kapeesh? You see, Boss Hawg had himself a pretty sweet deal goin' on for quite some time, and things -  they was peaceful. Then, he collaborates with freakin' Vampires and lets some shady characters in where they ain't got no business.

To make a long story short, I took his Tee-Vee. That's right, buddy-ol-pal! That was ME! The workin' one with the "snow music disco" screen.

Things was fine for a while then, and I had my laugh. I was even gonna give it back if his lazy butt was ever gonna travel my way, ye know? But that's not good enough for Boss Hawg. He sends 'is boys down here to take his Tee-Vee back, and now there's talk of war!

Hey - me? - I was just havin' Old fart can't take a joke anymore, I swear!

You don't owe me anything, you've helped us so much, but if you can find it in yourself to travel back and eliminate Bahmut, you could be saving dozens of potential lives!
CompleteText=You did it! My reports have said that the Wrath Stags have become a bit more timid and aren't showing as much aggression now that you cut the head off the snake.  I can't thank you enough! I know it's not much but here take this coin, and take this too. It was my fathers, but I want you to have it.

Title=Haunted Hill
BodyText=There is a slouching peak northeast of here - its true name lost to time, called now "Haunted Hill."

You think it trite? When you see the horrors that the earth vomits forth there, you willl be as bereft of description as the rest of us!

Even before the rise of the undead, there was the Outcast Wars  - which ended and began at once a new era in which we cower from hordes of the pustulent undead. The Beasts here fought for their lives, or fled. A few however, tried to "ride the storm out". This, like many things here, did not end well.


At the end of the resistance, less than one hundred beasts remained who could claim nativity to the once-bountiful Grunes Tal. Among those who survived was a noble family, the Folkirks. They made their fortune in the mining business, and having earned their wealth from The Iron Maw generations ago, not a single one of them had ever worked. That, friend, is what miners, and often slaves were for.

The remaining Beasts, knowing the Folkirk Manor to be a veritable fortress, decided to fall back and wait out the undead army.

The Folkirk family however, was not amused. Not a single Beast was let inside the manor doors, and legend has it that the family members could be seen watching their comrades being ripped to shreds by zombies right outside their windows.

Most of the resistance died within a week, if they could flee, less if not. Their vengeance-hungry ghosts still haunt that hill outside the manor to this day, but there is some justice in that the Folkirk family seems to have been "turned" into undead as well.

I cannot bear the anguished cries the wind carries any longer! Please, travel to Haunted Hill north of Redeemer's Camp. Put the Vengance-Singers out of their misery by freeing eleven of them from this realm.
CompleteText=Ah, at last, the anguished cries on the wind are no more! After you left I heard the cries of the Singers again for a short time, yet soon all went quiet. I was certain the sudden silence was your handiwork and I was right! Finally I can have some peace around here, not that there is much peace in a land filled with undead mind you, yet I will take what I can get!

At any rate, I can only hope those poor souls are finally at peace. I wish upon no beast the horrible fate they had to endure. Thanks again for your help!

Title=Foresight Of The Elders
BodyText=Hello there, might I have a word with you? If you are venturing into the crypt to the south to deal with the Wailer, perhaps you can take care of another matter as well?

For the longest time, Grunes Tal has had neutral to uneasy relations with the Warpigs in Swineland to the northeast. Their 'habits' seemingly bizarre to most beasts, they have been left for the most part to themselves in their own land. This was before the Vampires invaded mind you, yet most in Grunes Tal never understood these creatures even back then.

The Elders of Grunes Tal, though, long knew that there would probably come a time when we beasts would probably have need of aid from the Warpigs at some point in time and made the necessary 'arrangements' that would pretty much guarantee their cooperation.

The Warpigs, you see, have this very odd fascination with relics that come from the Age of Man and will do anything to obtain them as there is nothing in this world they cherish more.

During the Outcast Wars, the Elders located one of these relics and stashed it away knowing the people of Grunes Tal would have need of it as a gift of sorts for the Warpigs at some point in the future. It is said most people scoffed at the idea, yet our Elders proceeded to pass this relic down through the generations. It was Mason Stromfeld who made the most radical decision of all and had the relic buried with him upon his death. Being a beast of note, Mason was buried within the large crypt in the Iron Hills where most of the wealthy and well known beasts of Grunes Tal were interred.

After the Undead invaded and emptied the lands of Grunes Tal of most anything living, few if any with breath still in them have been near that crypt. Yet with the Undead presence, it is quite likely that anyone resting within that place has long since been revived.

We here at Redeemer's Hall feel the time has come to retrieve the relic Mason had buried with him and fulfill the purpose for which it was originally obtained. Thus, I task you with entering the Crypt and locating Mason Stromfeld's tomb. Inside you should find the relic among his bones. If the forces of Abidan have indeed revived him, there is a chance you will have to destroy him before claiming the item. We know not what exactly this relic is, yet Mason's tomb is it's resting place. Once you have it, return to me. Now hurry up and get out of here!
CompleteText=So, you survived did you? And you have the relic? Good, let me see it!

...

So, that's what it looks like. Hmm, I must say I wasn't expecting anything of this sort really. Anyway, on to the next task!"

Well, since you came all th' way here and brought me this nice 'n fancy object, I'll sees what I can do else my name ain't Norris th' Warpig Chief Protectorate! Before I'se agree to any deals, though, I have a job fer ya. Consider it a test, if'n you will, to see if youse worth yer weight in salt! Do this here favor for me, an' I'll sees what I can do abouts helpin' out th' Redeemers.

Th' job? Well, it's simple. I wants youse to get rid o' Boss Hawg's boys fer me. Awhile back, Hawg an' his boys from th' Haz'ard Crew over in the Swineland went all crazy like and invited th' dang dambats inta the place like it was nobody's business. Since then, those dambats have been stirrin' up trouble over there an' many a warpig was forced ta leave their homes!

Now some of em, they come over here fer refuge from both th' dambats and Boss Hawg himself. Youse see, some of us warpigs, we don't care fer Hawg's business and want 'im removed. A bunch o' warpigs been tryin' for some time now to deal with him, but, haven't been that successful. Now, I'se come to learn ol' Dirty Thunder got under Hawg's skin recently over some misunderstandin' an' Hawg, he sent his boys over here ta deal with th' problem.

Now, I can't have Hawg stickin his snout in where it ain't his business! This here warpig camp is mine an' Boss Hawg aint' got no a'thority on this side o' th' river. So, if'n you an' the Redeemer's are a wantin' my help, head outside an' get rid o' Hawg's boys. Hogcatchers is what he calls em! They're like his enforcers, ya see. They've set up several camps round my town see? I wants em eliminated or sent back ta Hawg or both! Matters not how youse handle em, just get rid of em!
CompleteText=Well now, ain't youse somethin'! I'se could hear ol' Hawg's boys a squealin' fer mercy from here! That oughta teach em' not ta go a messin' in 'nother warpig's business when they ain't got no business bein' here! Well, I'm a warpig of my word, so, youse tell them Redeemers ol' Norris'll sees whats he can do 'bout assistin' em as agreed!

Title=The Missing Envoy
BodyText=Hello there. It's nice to see a friendly face among so many ruffians! Don't misunderstand, our collaboration with the warpigs both here and in Swineland has been invaluable even if a bit on rocky terms. Even still, I never expected to be hung up here!

*Sigh* I apologize friend. It would seem my temper has gotten the better of me of late. You see I have a problem. Several days ago I was sent from the Redeemer's Camp in Swineland to meet up with an envoy from our fellow Redeemers here in Grunes Tal. We were supposed to meet here at the Warpig Protectorate Camp at the borders of Swineland, but, my contact has not arrived.

I am full aware of the dangers of the Undead hordes that infest this land and would rather not stay too long; however, the person I have been sent to meet was carrying information that would greatly assist the Redeemers against both the Undead here and the Vampires in Swineland. It has been almost a week now and I have become worried that something has happened to my contact.

Since you appear to be strong, would you do me this favor and look for the envoy sent from the Hall? If you happen to find the envoy alive, please inform them that their contact is waiting at the Warpig encampment. If the worst has happened and they have fallen victim to the vile forces of Abidan, then please retrieve the documents I was sent to collect in their stead.

I shall wait here in the meantime.
CompleteText=You return. And the Envoy? ...I see. So, you found his camp and he was already dead? That is sad news indeed.

Were you able to at least locate the documents? ...Yes, these appear to be the items I was sent to retrieve. While I am indeed saddened that a fellow Redeemer has met such a terrible end, I am at least grateful that all was not lost and you were able to complete the mission in their stead. Thank you for delivering these to me along with the news of my contact's fate.

Title=The Wailing Crypt
BodyText=There are crypts south of Redeemer's Hall, which were built as respectful places of rememberance by the Beast-Founders of Grunes Tal years ago. Yes, there are graveyards aplenty which surround us, but these crypts bear all-too-familiar family names. The surviving members of the famlies have a vested interest in making sure their relatives' remains sleep soundly, and never make it to the Village Crier's List of shocking undead murderers. You can also assume that they will pay handsomely for this task, and for your discretion.

The largest crypt within the graveyard has been reported as having caused a spot of trouble. There is a pitiful wailing coming from within, which has lured some beasts inside to investigate the source of the sound - never to return. I doubt now that the cries come from a wounded or lost child, as it may sound like at first.

At any rate, you will need to eliminate any likely witnesses, in case The Wailer hails from a family of note. Travel to The Crypts far south of Redeemer's Hall within Iron Hils, and eliminate six Crypt Diggers as well as eight Risen Corpses.

The Crypt is the home of a Revenant called the Wailer. This crypt is the largest and most evil looking in all of The Crypts. It is made of stone and lavishly decorated. 
CompleteText=So, there are no more witnesses to the Wailer's incessant noise? Good. At least now whoever's family the Wailer comes from will not have their loved one's...actions exposed.

The rest of my party were not so lucky. But maybe ... just maybe ... some good of their misfortune may yet come.

Deep inside the crypt where the wailer wails, there are two strange braziers of unknown origin. The scholar in our party deduced that a sacrifice may spark their coals, releasing ancient magic to take effect and bind the Wailer to our realm.

Title=The Revenant
BodyText=Now that there will be no more.. how shall we say... 'witnesses' to The Wailer's...well, wailing... it is time to deal with the creature itself and silence it once and for all. Return to the graveyard, friend, and enter the Wailing Crypt itself. While I know not what unsightly horrors lie within that place, intel has claimed that the wails from this revenant seem to come from deep inside the Crypt. I have also been told the Elders of Grunes Tal at times added little puzzles for would-be looters to try and solve if they dared to disturb their resting places.

Be wary when in the Crypt, though. More than a few would-be adventurers, and even a few groups we here at the Hall have assembled, have entered that place, yet none have returned. Perhaps there is more to these 'puzzles' than most know. While searching for The Wailer's 'resting' place, be on the lookout for clues on how to get past the Elders' Crypt puzzles. Surely some of these will help solve the mystery of the Wailer's existence.

Return to me once you have taken care of The Wailer and have put it's obviously restless soul to a final peace.
CompleteText=You return safely friend! The Wailer has been put to rest? Excellent. Remember friend, keep The Wailer's identity to yourself for the sake of the family it belonged to. It is scandal enough that the creature was even causing problems. By eliminating that revenant as an issue, the families whose loved ones rest in that crypt can be rest assured their good names will not be tainted by this incident. Please accept one of these as thanks from both myself and the families whose reputations you have preserved. They, themselves, might not wish to say it, but I do. Take care and good fortune in your travels!

BodyText=Greetings good beast, it's nice to see another reach the Redeemer camp.  These days that's a rare sight.  Especially due to the increasing threat of the feral creatures of Grunes Tal. They seem to be breeding rather quick and now are starting to wander into our camp, threatening lives.  You seem like you can handle yourself, would you take care of them? 
CompleteText=Fantastic! You've done it, but there are more beasts of the wild that need handling if you're up for it.
