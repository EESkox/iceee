Title=The True Form Of Nobility
BodyText=If you have spoken to my friend Shayne, then you know the atrocities which occurred at Haunted Hill. I would send you within the Folkirk Manor itself, to eliminate an ancient Beast family so evil, I believe that they were not turned by any invading zombie to their home. Instead, their dust-filled veins simply took on their true forms when the undead invvaded!

Enter the Manor, friend, and have no fear of the sort of parlour tricks, tickling spiders or creaking doorways  within. Focus on the family Folkirk and eliminate their existance from Gaia's sight! Search for the Uncle Moldyfork, Father Grundy, Mother Cruella and their little dog too! Scraps, I think, is the name of their killer hound. 
CompleteText=So those vile Folkirks have finally met the end they so long ago deserved? That is good news indeed.

At long last those whose lives were lost because of them have the vengeance they have long cried for. Friend, your deeds have closed the book on one of the most tragic stories ever to come from this now-blighted region. Please take one of these items with you before you go and may Gaia watch over you. Farewell.
