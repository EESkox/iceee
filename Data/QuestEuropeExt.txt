Title=The Rotted Maze
BodyText=You had done much to aid in our fight, young one. Now the time has come for me to ask you to take the ultimate risk. To go into the depths of the Rotted Maze and face the fiends that dwell there.

The once grand hedge is a maze of corridors, now filled with the vile, corrupt, breeding of the Pact of Decay. Within the wither walls lies death and despair. The effective of proximity of the Rotted King, and the pure corruption, does not allow for my brethren to enter within. This is why I ask you, young one, to go into the Rotted Maze in our 'sted.

Inside, you must first kill the Lost One. The oldest and most corrupt of the Black Shroomie ilk. A festering, cankerous, evil that must be slain.

Then, you must steel you heart, friend. For beyond the decay of the Lost One lies the true face of corruption, The Rotted King himself. I can only ask you of your own free will to risk all for our cause. I can only hope you will take this one final charge from me.
CompleteText=Young one, you have proven yourself be be brave, valorous and a friend. We thank you for your bravery and hope we now can finish this long war.

Take what you will from the Treekin Chest next to me. You have earned your reward.

Farewell, friend.

Title=Eye of the Lost One
BodyText=Again, I can use your assistance! I have divined the next piece for my new wand. This piece, I am afraid, is very difficult to obtain, for it lies in the deepest depths of the Deadwood within the Rotten Maze. In the maze lurk many horrors. One such horror is the Lost One, the most ancient and putrid of the Amanita Virosa. It is from this creature that the final piece of my wand can be gained. I need one of its eyes. The Lost One lives in the center of the maze, functioning as both a source of rot and as a clear barrier to all who would seek to slay the Rotted King. If you have both the nerve and heart to penetrate the depths of the maze, and retrieve one of the Lost One's eyes, then I will reward you in a manner equal to the task.
CompleteText=You have the Eye! Friend, you are a true hero of our time. The components for my wand are now complete, but there is still work to do. To create a wand of this caliber requires it to be forged in a special way. I have much research to do. Return to me again, for I may still require help to finish constructing the wand. For now, take this key and you can open the second chest, and take one item of your choosing. Choose wisely.

While she and I never truly cared for each other, other than the respect of each other's power, I cannot allow any of my previous companion's items to fall into the hands of mortals... *ahem* ...the wrong beasts. To the east, in and around the old Rolsburg Mine, you will find the Dominion has stepped onto New Badari soil. It is in the mine you will find Vangar One-Eye. He is very ruthless and he is also in possession of Jarnsaxa's Pendant. While I have no fear he could ever tap its true power, I just cannot allow such an artifact to be loose in this world. Go to the mine and kill Vangar One-Eye. Take the pendant and return it to me. Go now! Do not delay.
CompleteText=Again, you have not failed me. Perhaps Lucius is right, you are a special one. I will put the pendant somewhere safe from the grip of those who may wish to use it for their own ends. Again, I will reward you for this task. Take this key. It will open the chest to my left and you may once more take one item of your choosing. Farewell.

Title=The Quarter Note Quill
BodyText=Hail adventurer! My name is Chanticleer, Bremen's finest musician and composer! I need a stout adventurer for a most harrowing mission to retrieve the Quarter-Note Quill. It is a legendary musical artifact. It can transcribe the notes of a musician as he plays them - a wondrous item. The problem is, the quill currently resides in Rapunzel's Tower. I shall reward you well if you would retrieve it. Before you say yes, are you familiar with the story of the tower?
Long ago, these lands were ruled by the cruel Otto family. The patron of the family was a brave beast and well deserving of praise. With his death, the entire family line soon went to rot. Generations later begins the tale of the Grimm family, two brothers and their sister, Aristal. At the time, a beast known as Von Hugo was the head of the Otto family and ruler of this land. He fell in love with Aristal. She rebuked his advances, but he would not relent. The brothers were so worried for Aristal, they tried to sneak her away in the dark of night, but to no avail. Von Bruno's men caught them and took Aristal to Von Bruno, at the same time banishing the brothers from this land to the faraway lands across the frozen seas. Von Bruno forced Aristal to marry him. On their wedding day, the Brothers Grimm cursed the Otto family. They called on the power of all the gods both good and evil, real and imagined, to cause the entire family to be forever cursed. Legend tells that their pleas were heard but by strange forces normally unknown to this world. Time passed and Aristal gave birth to a baby girl named Rapunzel. On her 16th birthday she went mad - raving insane! She claimed she heard voices whispering to her and told stories of being taken away in the night! To make matters worse she seemed to have developed some kind of magical power and in her insane fury it would lash out at those around her. Von Bruno could not stand this and built a tower east of Rolsburg. He locked his own daughter in the highest reaches. The entire tower was affected by her madness. The magical power in her began to warp and change the tower into the crazed creation it is today. This would not be the end of the despair for the Otto family. Over the next few generations, the family was beset by tragedy. Two sons and a daughter followed a beast playing a pipe over the bridge to Midlands and were never seen again. Wolves were known to chase members of the family at every turn. Some members of the family fell into a deep sleep, never to reawaken. These strange things continued to happen until the entire Otto family ceased to exist, except, perhaps, for Rapunzel. Some say she is still alive in the tower, made immortal by her madness.
CompleteText=Is that it? It seems so mundane, but to touch it - yes I can feel the magic it possesses. You have not let me down. Take this key. You can use it to open the chest behind me. Take one item of your choosing and use it well! Thank you and farewell.

Title=Sand Goliaths
BodyText=Hello once again, friend! When we last met, I told you I would ask for your help when the time was right. That time has now come. Recently, we in Bazaart have begun to actively trade with the peaceful Outcast encampment of Oslis high up in Cracked Rock in the hopes of establishing a good relationship with them. Unfortunately, our merchants have encountered a stumbling block of sorts...well, more like stumbling ROCKS to be more accurate.

You see, along the nearest road between Bazaart and Oslis at the base of the cliffs there is a large gathering of Sand Goliaths. Normally docile unless disturbed, these creatures have recently become rather aggressive and have been attacking any caravans that attempt the road between here and Oslis. I have been told the Merchants' Guild has ordered all subsequent caravans to use the more northern pass to avoid the Goliaths and more losses.

Reports claim that there is a Goliath, they call it Brewtus, that seems to have begun leading them on these raids. Do everyone in both Bazaart and Oslis this favor and travel to the base of the cliffs just southeast of Bazaart and eliminate both Brewtus and as many Sand Goliaths as you can. With the loss of their new-found leader and thinned numbers, the Goliaths will hopefully return to being mostly docile allowing the caravans to once again use the road.

Return to me once they have been dealt with.
CompleteText=Excellent work! Now that the Sand Goliaths are no longer a threat, we can reinforce our trade with Oslis. Unfortunately, we have an even bigger problem now.

Title=The Cult of the Sand Dragon
BodyText=While you were out taking care of the Sand Goliaths, we in Bazaart received some grave news.

You might have noticed the numerous piles of dragon skeletons scattered around the Dust Fields just east of Bazaart while in your travels. The large sandstone hills to the southeast are covered in them at the top and some of us here in Bazaart have come to call that place 'The Dragon's Nest'.

I assure you, this name was chosen for good reason. High atop the Dragon's Nest, lies a dragon very much alive and well. For the longest time it has slept peacefully and left the people of Dustshore and Cracked Rock alone for the most part. However, I have been informed that the creature might be awake once more.

Some time ago, a strange group of lisians moved into the Sand Fields and took residence among the dragon bones littering the land. We have been cautiously observing them because of their apparent fascination with the sleeping dragon high atop the Nest. Reports have stated they claim to be the offspring of the dragon and they worship it like a god. They have even given the dragon a name: Kerakura.

Up until recently, this so-called 'Brood of Kerakura' cult has been mostly harmless; however, now it seems they have become a threat. I have been told it seems their close proximity to Bazaart was no accident and that, with their increasing numbers, they could easily stage an attack on this town.

On behalf of the people of Bazaart and, indeed all of Dustshore and those up in Cracked Rock, I ask you to head to the encampments of the Kerakura Brood and utterly destroy them. The incursions of the Anubians in recent times have already cost us much and we do not need a bunch of cultists stirring up even more trouble. 
CompleteText=You return safely I see, but, there is yet one final task to be undertaken.

Title=The Dragon's Nest
BodyText=Now that most of the Brood of Kerakura has been dealt with, it is time to deal the fatal blow.

As mentioned before, the dragon Kerakura resides at the top of the craggy sandstone hills dubbed 'The Dragon's Nest'. Reports state that there are a few members of the Kerakura cult that directly attend the dragon and stay in close proximity to it.

You must head to the Dragon's Nest and not only finish off the cultists, but, defeat Kerakura as well. Should Kerakura fully awaken, it would be a catastrophe to everyone in not only Dustshore, but, the surrounding regions as well.

Because Kerakura is likely to be quite dangerous, I would suggest taking friends along with you. Return to me after you have slain Kerakura and put an end to the cult's fascination with her.
CompleteText=You return safely! What news do you bring? The dragon is dead? That is great news! With Kerakura gone, we can all once again breathe a sigh of relief.

Friend, you have done so much for the people of Dustshore. Although this isn't much, please accept one of these items as a show of gratitude for your deeds. Safe journey on your travels, friend!
