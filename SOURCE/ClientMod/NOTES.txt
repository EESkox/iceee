Extract your CAR files elsewhere, then use CARDecode to convert:
Catalogs.car -> Catalogs.zip
EarthEternal.car -> EarthEternal.zip

You way want to keep backup copies on hand in case you screw anything up, plus maybe a script to quickly restore the original.  Script everything you can, following these steps dozens of times gets very tedious.





-----  Catalogs.car  -----

Requires utilities in the working folder: EEUtilAbilityTable.exe, sq.exe

_COMPILEABILITIES.bat is a batch script to copy the abilities file to the current working directory and compile it.  Edit the script to adjust the location where to copy AbilityTable.txt from.

_COMPILECATALOGS.bat compiles all the extension scripts.

Add all CNUT files into Catalogs.zip:
  Abilities.cnut
  AssetDependenciesEx.cnut
  AttachableEx.cnut
  ComponentsEx.cnut
  CreaturesEx.cnut
  MediaEx.cnut

Within Catalogs.zip is a subfolder, AssetDependencies.  Copy AssetDependencies/Horde-Beast_Catapult.deps.cnut there.

Convert Catalogs.zip back to Catalogs.car


AssetDependencies.txt was a text dump of existing dependency data (maybe from 0.8.6) but is useful as an example to see how they're set up.





-----  EarthEternal.car  -----

Requires utilities in the working folder: sq.exe

_COMPILE.bat will compile all necessary NUT files, including the ones in subfolders.

Add all the CNUT files to EarthEternal.zip
  Addons.cnut
  AdvCraft.cnut
  DngScale.cnut
  EmoteBrowser.cnut
  GroveTools.cnut
  IGForum.cnut
  ModSettings.cnut
  MoreStats.cnut
  PetScreen.cnut
  SceneObjectHack.cnut
  Version.cnut

Within EarthEternal.zip are two subfolders: States, UI
Add the corresponding CNUT files into those folders.

TWO EXCEPTIONs:
UI/Inventory.cnut is a binary hack of the original copy from version 0.8.6 that removes the "Buy More Bags" button.  This file is specific to 0.8.6 and should not be used in other versions, as it may break them.

States/CharacterSelectionState.cnut is a binary hack of the original that changes the number of allowed characters.  Use the newer CharacterSelectionStateHack.cnut instead.


Some PF mod scripts don't work with 0.8.9 (Ikimonogatari/EER) due to the revamped UI.  ModSettings.nut in particular won't load, but there may be other problems too.  If there are any script errors, Player.log (automatically generated by Spark.exe when the client runs) will report any errors.  You will need to adjust some of the scripts and recompile them.





-----  Hacks  ----- 

Add Hacks.cnut to EarthEternal.car for client-side movement hacks.  See Hacks.nut for info.





-----  EXAMPLEHTTPCHECKSUM.bat  -----

Requires utilities in the working folder: md5.exe
Here's an example script that will prepare HTTPChecksums.txt
Copy all modified CAR files to the folder, and edit the script to process them accordingly.
Run the script and copy the new HTTPChecksum.txt into the server's location Data/HTTPChecksum.txt, replacing it.





-----  Router  -----
Use this file if you need the router port hack for a modded client, to connect to a port other than 4242.

In your client folder, where Spark.exe is located.  Open the cache folder, then open the folder for the domain you're connecting to, then the cookies folder.  The folders will look something like this:
\cache\localhost Q\cookies\

Place Router in the cookies folder, then launch the client.  For as long as Router exists in the folder, the hack will be operational when you connect to that domain.

NOTE: If you launched the client using a custom port, it will have something extra in the folder's domain name, like localhost Q. This is because the client does not natively support launching to a URL with a specific port like:
http://localhost:81/Release/Current/EarthEternal.car

The extra letter is the ASCII representation of the port number (P, Q, etc correspond to port 80, 81, etc)
